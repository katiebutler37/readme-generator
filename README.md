## Description
- The motivation for creating this repository was to limit the amount of time spent creating README files in the final stages of project development and deployment.
- This application helps to avoid incomplete or lower quality README files from being created, while also guiding the user through prompts to make structuring the file much easier.
- While creating this application, I was able to apply new knowledge of Node.js, Inquirer and template literals in JavaScript, learning new development skills and strengthening existing skills in ES6 and markdown.
